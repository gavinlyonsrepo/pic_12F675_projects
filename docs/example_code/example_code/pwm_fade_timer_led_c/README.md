The program fades in and out a LED attached to GP4 by loading timer0 with a 8-bit PWM value.

Whenever timer0 expires and an interrupt is generated, then interrupt ISR() function is executed. In this function, depending upon the state of the PWM_PIN (i-e if it is high or low), timer0 register is loaded with appropriate value. There is a global variable with the name of PWM defined in the code. This variable can have a value from 0 (0% duty cycle) to 255 (100% duty cycle).  PWM variable is changed in the main function to automatically change the duty cycle of the PWM wave. 

In the timer init  function, OPTION_REG is initialized to make timer0 prescalar to be 1:32. Timer0 is an 8bit timer, so it expires after reaching a value of 255. When timer0 prescalar is made 1:32 then

Whenever timer0 expires, then an interrupt is generated which executes the ISR function. In this function, GP4 pin is toggled every time and timer0 interrupt flag is cleared.
